This is how stuff is processed:

a. MatchMode is loaded
    1.  lgofnoc/lgofnoc_plugins.cfg
    2.  lgofnoc/<config>/lgofnoc_plugins.cfg
    3.  plugins are locked
    4.  lgofnoc/lgofnoc_once.cfg
    5.  lgofnoc/<config>/lgofnoc_plugins.cfg
    6.  map is restarted after 5 seconds
b. On every OnMapStart
    1.  lgofnoc/lgofnoc.cfg
    2.  lgofnoc/<config>/lgofnoc.cfg
    3.  lgofnoc/<mapname>.cfg
    4.  lgofnoc/<config>/<mapname>.cfg
c. MatchMode is unloaded
    1.  unlocks plugins
    2.  unloads all plugins except lgofnoc
    3.  lgofnoc/lgofnoc_off.cfg
    4.  lgofnoc/<config>/lgofnoc_off.cfg
    5.  optionally? restarts map

Client Commands:
    lgofnoc_cvarsettings    - lists convars that are being enforced by lgofnoc
    lgofnoc_cvardiff        - lists cvars that have been changed from initial values

Admin Commands:  
    sm_softmatch    <config>    - same as forcematch, but will fail if a match mode is loaded already
    sm_forcematch   <config>    - the usual; will unload the current match mode if one is loaded
    sm_resetmatch   <config>    - the usual

Server Commands:
    lgofnoc_addcvar     - the usual
    lgofnoc_setcvars    - starts enforcement of added cvars
    lgofnoc_resetcvars  - resets all added cvars, can't be used during a match
    lgofnoc_loadplugin  <plugin>    - as far as I can tell all it does is make it so you don't have to worry about whether a plugin is in the main dir or in optional/
