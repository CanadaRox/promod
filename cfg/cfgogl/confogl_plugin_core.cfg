//Plugin loads for core features present in most or all configs
//e.g. hittable control, tank control, etc
//NOTE: Most unorthodox configs should not exec this! Plugins typically alter behaviour just by being loaded, 
//by not having an enable cvar or not defaulting to 'disabled'

//TODO: move core plugin loads here
